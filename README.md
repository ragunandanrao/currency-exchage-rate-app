# Getting Started with Currency exchange rate chart app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
I made edits and added the logic as needed to the barebone project structure provided. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm i` 

and later run

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\

Once you load the page you will view the App page which has links to the Home page and Docs page. 

* The Docs page contains the documentation for this project and mentions the architecture, choices and assumptions made in the course of the project. 
* The Home page opens up a view where you can select 2 dates between which you would like to observe the trend of the currency USD and EUR. 
  * You have to select the "Start date" and the "End date" using the date pickers provided. 
  * Once you do that, click on the "Submit" button to see the graph or update the graph in case you changed the dates.  

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
The app is ready to be deployed!
